# Inferential-Statistics
A Shiny App that I created, which can be used to perform t-test, f-test and Chi-Square Test of Independance.

This is the Link to the App: https://a-u1234.shinyapps.io/Hypothesis-Tests/ (The link takes a few seconds to open completely)

I have compiled all the programs that I wrote in the My-Shiny-Journey repository to create this App.
